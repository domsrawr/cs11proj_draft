## NEED TO UPDATE:
- maybe tile_symbols need to be CAPS since technically enum siya?
- we need more _detailed_ documentation, like literal 10+ lines per function or smth idk
- bonus features!!
- to tomorrow me, check if resetting tiles and gamestate b4 game_over_input is redundant since i is passed to process_input nmn
