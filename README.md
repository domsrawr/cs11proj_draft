# IMPORTANT!!!
- ### need to be able to accept string arguments where it'll make output file!!
- ### should be able to utilize -m and -f flags
- ### there should be a default map when stagefile arg is not inputted
- #### include in documentation that when larry dies/wins, ALL SUBSEQUENT INPUTS ARE NOT PROCESSED! (including !)

## NEED TO UPDATE:
- maybe tile_symbols need to be CAPS since technically enum siya?
- we need more _detailed_ documentation, like literal 10+ lines per function or smth idk
- bonus features!!
- to tomorrow me, check if resetting tiles and gamestate b4 game_over_input is redundant since i is passed to process_input nmn
