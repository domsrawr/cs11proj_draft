# IMPORTANT!!!
- ### need to be able to accept string arguments where it'll make output file!!
- ### should be able to utilize -m and -f flags
- ### there should be a default map when stagefile arg is not inputted

## NEED TO UPDATE:
- maybe tile_symbols need to be CAPS since technically enum siya?
- we need more _detailed_ documentation, like literal 10+ lines per function or smth idk
- bonus features!!

### Update Log:
**11/8/2025 3:33 PM**
- Fixed logic when won/lost
- "WWWD!AAA" where larry dies on D; 
- - before: '!AAA' does not register
- - after: '!AAA' registers
- added reset_game() function on main.py to simply gamestate and tile resetting
